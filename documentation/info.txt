The MathDox formula editor

The MathDox formula editor allows users of web-applications to easily type in
mathematical formulas. It can be used instead of a textarea in an HTML form. To
the developer of the web-application it will seem as if the user entered the
formula in OpenMath code. The MathDox formula editor is written in Javascript,
so it can be integrated into any webpage without requiring a plug-in to be
installed in the web-browser. It is realeased under an open-source license to
encourage its use and allow collaboration on expanding its capabilities. Since
last year a lot of new symbols have been added aswell as an optional palette,
which makes it easier to enter them. It is now also possible to add additional
simple keywords and functions (like pi or sin) by editing an XML file.
