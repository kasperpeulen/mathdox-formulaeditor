      A lot of functions are entered and displayed in a similar way. They
      consist of a function name (some word) followed by an opening bracket
      <quote>(</quote>, a single argument, and a closing bracket
      <quote>)</quote>.
    </para>

      If these functions are added with javascript code, then the code would be
      very similar for all of them. This can lead to errors if people copy code
      and do not take the time to properly edit it. Furthermore if some changes
      need to be made, then these changes will have to be made to all the
      different files.

      These problems do not appear if a single template or
      <emphasis>model</emphasis> is used to generate the code for several of
      these functions by only having to enter a few entries per function. This
      article describes how this has been made possible and how it can be used
      and extended.
