The MathDox formula editor

The MathDox formula editor is a web-based editor for mathematical
formulas. It has been developed at the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven
as a means for students to enter formulas in an e-learning environment.
Its main features are listed below:

* It has a two-dimensional WYSIWYG interface (rephrase ?).
* It can produce a semantic representation of the formula (OpenMath).
* No plugins need to be installed in the browser to use the editor .
* It can be easily integrated into existing HTML pages.
* It is available under an open source license (LGPL).

With the addition of more symbols and an optional palette and some
speed improvements, the formulaeditor is now ready to be used.
