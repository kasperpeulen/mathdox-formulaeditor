      <h3>MathDox formula editor</h3>

      <p>
        The MathDox formula editor is a web-based editor for mathematical
        formulas. It is currently being developed at the Technische Universiteit
        Eindhoven as a means for students to enter formulas in an e-learning
        environment. Its main features are listed below.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          It has a <em>two-dimensional WYSIWYG</em> interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          It can produce a <em>semantic</em> representation of the formula.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>No plugins</em> need to be installed in the browser to use the
          editor.
        </li>
        <li>
          It can be easily <em>integrated into existing HTML</em> pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is available under an <em>open source</em> license.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The editor is written in Javascript and uses the HTML5 canvas element in
        combination with jsMath sprite fonts to render mathematics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any questions or comments about the editor are welcome and can be
        directed at <a href='mailto:info@mathdox.org'>info@mathdox.org</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Demo</h4>

      <p>
        The following formulas can be edited using your keyboard. Feel free to
	experiment. Supported are among others: integers, floating point
	numbers, variables, some keywords (like sin and pi), multiplication
	(*), division (/), addition (+), subtraction (-) and exponents (^). 
      </p>
      <p>
	It is possible to show zero, one or multiple palettes that can be used
	to insert something at the cursor position of the formulaeditor with
	focus. With this palette it is also possible to enter matrices and
	(square) roots.
      </p>

      <p>
        To see an OpenMath representation of the first formula above
        <a href='javascript:alert(document.getElementById("formula1").value)'>
        click here</a>. This demonstrates that a semantic tree of the formula
	is stored, and not just a presentation tree. To see a MathML
	representation of the first formula above <a
	href='javascript:alert(org.mathdox.formulaeditor.FormulaEditor.getEditorByTextArea("formula1").getMathML())'>click
	here</a>. Note that the conversion to MathML has not been tested
	 exhaustively and does still contain errors.
      </p>

      <h4>Usage</h4>

      <p>
	Please be warned that this editor is still being extended; it is
	however used in our <a href='http://mathdox.org/'>MathDox software</a>.
        Having said that, if you want to use the formula editor in a webpage,
        there are two ways to do so. The first method is by including a
        reference to the main javascript file at the mathdox.org server:
      </p>

      <p class='code'>
        &lt;script type='text/javascript'
        src='http://mathdox.org/formulaeditor/main.js'>&lt;/script>
      </p>

      <p>
        The second (alternative) method is by copying the formulaeditor
        javascript sources to the same location as the webpage, and reference
        the main javascript file from there:
      </p>

      <p class='code'>
        &lt;script type='text/javascript'
        src='org/mathdox/formulaeditor/main.js'>&lt;/script>
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition you also need to add a textarea of class 'mathdoxformula' at
        the place where you want the formula editing field to appear:
      </p>

      <p class='code'>
        &lt;textarea class='mathdoxformula'>&lt;/textarea>
      </p>

      <h4>Download</h4>
      <p>
        Webpage authors that want to deploy the formula editor javascript
        sources to their own website can download the following package:
      </p>

      <p>
      <a href='http://mathdox.org/download/formulaeditor-${version}.zip'
        >formulaeditor-${version}.zip</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Developers that are interested in changing the formulaeditor itself, can
        checkout the source from the
        <a href='http://subversion.tigris.org/'>subversion</a> repository at:
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href='https://mathdox.org/svn/repos/public/formulaeditor'
        >https://mathdox.org/svn/repos/public/formulaeditor</a>
      </p>

      <h4>Known limitations</h4>

      <p>
        Currently this editor has only been tested in Mozilla Firefox (v2) and
        Microsoft Internet Explorer (v7). Support for the other main browsers
        (Safari, Opera, Konqueror) will be added later.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only a very limited set of mathematical operations is supported right
        now.
